## TODOS

- [ ] The app is highly dependent on the [Meal DB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) Create an `.env` file in the root of the folder (if does not exists) and specify the following key

| KEY                  | VALUE                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| REACT_APP_MEALDB_API | https://www.themealdb.com/ |

## Build Steps

After you have cloned the repository, head out to the **RecipeFinder** folder and have a look at the `package.json` file in the root of that folder.

![Project Dependencies](readmeassets/dependencies.png)
![Project Scripts](readmeassets/scripts.png)

**Have a look at the dependencies, and the build scripts**

After you have looked into the supported scripts, you should have decided to serve a development version or a production version.

- `yarn run dev` to create a development server. NOTE: The port of the dev server is reflected in the **dev** server as in the `.env` file.
  ![Status of yarn dev](readmeassets/yarndev.png)
- `yarn build` to create a production version of the app. After this command is executed, find the static assets generated into the **build/** folder from which you can serve the static site.

## Problem Statement

**Goal**: You have to create a web page using React, which looks like the image below:

Project Screenshot

On this web page, you can enter the name of a dish that you want information on into a search input field. Once you find the required information, you can display it on the web page.

You’ll be using an API provided by TheMealDB. You can read more about the API at this link - [https://www.themealdb.com/](https://www.themealdb.com/)

## Guidelines

**Heading**

- The page should have a prominent heading on the lines of “Recipe Finder”.
- When the page loads for the first time, there should be a sub-header on the main page saying ‘Type a Dish Name to Search for its Ingredients’, as shown in the screenshot below.
- This Sub-heading should be below both the heading of the page and the search bar

**Search Bar**

- There should be a search bar at the top of the web page, where the user can enter the name of a dish that he/she wants to search.
- The search bar should contain a placeholder telling the user to type the search query in the input box

Project Screenshot

- There should be a button to the right of the search bar, by clicking which you can make an API call to TheMealDB.
- Here’s what the search bar and the button should look like:

Project Screenshot

**Error Page**

- In case the API call fails, you need to show the following error message on the screen: “No Data has been received”.
- This is what the home screen is supposed to look like if there is an error:

**Search Results**

- TheMealDB API will return the search results in the form of a JSON response. A sample JSON response would be in this format:

![Project Screenshot](https://cdn.upgrad.com/UpGrad/temp/e9a542df-aa93-442a-84f5-ead2e3ba081d/Screenshot+from+2019-02-18+17-14-35.png)

- You will receive an array of meals in a successful response, and you have to show the different meals that you’ve received as a response in panels. Each meal should be given a panel of its own.
- The panels should look like this:

![Project Screenshot](https://cdn.upgrad.com/UpGrad/temp/665b8414-49e1-4f38-bb1e-32c93ccf9a78/Screenshot+from+2019-02-18+15-07-17.png)

The information contained in the panel includes the following:

- **Title**: The title of the meal should be mentioned in bold, similar to a panel header. There should be a heart emoji beside the title that acts as a ‘like’ button for a particular recipe/meal. If you like that recipe/meal, you can click on the heart button, which will then turn red. Clicking on the heart button again should ‘unlike’ the recipe/meal. This should happen for all the meals independently.
- Upon clicking on the title of the meal, the page should be redirected to the source URL of the meal that is provided in the JSON response.
- This is what the header would look like when this functionality is implemented:

Project Screenshot

- When a particular meal is liked, it should look like this:

Project Screenshot

- The body panel should be comprised of the following information:
  - The picture of the meal
  - The category of the meal
  - The area of the meal
  - The ingredients
  - The recipe
- This information should be arranged in the following manner:
  - The picture of the meal should be displayed prominently to the left.
  - On the right-hand side, the category of the meal and the area of the meal should be mentioned.
  - The ingredients should be mentioned, with their quantities against them.
  - The ingredient panel should have a fixed height (250px). Any extra text should overflow.
  - Below the list of ingredients, show the recipe. Similar to the ingredient panel, the recipe div should have a fixed height, and the text should overflow.
  - This is what the right-side panel is supposed to look like:
